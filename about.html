            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
              Welcome to my portfolio page! I am Laura, a self-taught frontend developer based in
              the UK. After a successful 10 years working in the property management sector, I have
              gone through an exciting career change into web development.<br />
              As a Frontend Developer, I am driven by a passion for coding and design, thriving on
              creative problem-solving and enthusiastic about learning new technologies.
              Collaboration is at the heart of my approach and I enjoy working in a team where the
              exchange of ideas brings projects to life. I am creative, with a good eye for detail,
              always trying to spot errors before products go live. <br />
              In my spare time, when I'm not immersed in code or pursuing courses, you'll find me
              taking a walk in nature, practicing Yoga or Pilates, finding serenity through
              meditation and getting lost in the pages of captivating books.

        </li>
        <li>
          Identified errors in current processes and provided effective solutions, reducing
          processing time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extended the existing API documentation to ensure clarity for both current and future
          employees.
        </li>

        <li>
          Wrote comprehensive product documentation and trained the design team on the latest
          products, thus improving overall team efficiency.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Achievements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed the <strong>Spotlight</strong> template which uses tap and hold functionality to
          draw attention to the ad by bringing focus to a specific area. This project enhanced the
          ad units and achieved a 0.33% to 2% user engagement rate. It was created to address
          limitations in the existing ad software, thus expanding the company‚Äôs product offerings.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Developed the <strong>Adaptive Tap & Hold</strong> template which reveals an image when
          the user taps and holds hotspots on the screen. The image can either follow the finger
          movement or remain static. It also changes the call to action based on the user‚Äôs last
          clicked product. The template was built to operate seamlessly across various ad formats,
          mobile and desktop, whether over images or video. It achieved a 0.25% engagement rate and
          addressed the need to provide users with dynamic ways to reveal images based on their
          interactions. It also provides clients with dynamic ways to reveal their products images
          based on user interaction.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Developed a <strong>Sidebar</strong> template to address the limitation in the existing
          software component which functioned on tap instead of drag. The template allows the user
          to drag a sidebar with their finger to reveal products from left to right or from right to
          left (option customizable by the designer). This project was built around existing Celtra
          software components and allowed the design team to use it in conjunction with an animated
          image gallery.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
